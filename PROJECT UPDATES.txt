UPDATED THE PROJECT TO FLUTTER 2
- NO CHANGES ON THE WEB FILES
- IF YOU HAVE DONE MAJOR CHANGES ON THE FLUTTER PROJECT, SEND US A MAIL TO ADVISE ON HOW YOU CAN UPDATE YOUR PROJECT.
- THE PROJECT NOTES SECTION NOW DEPENDS ON FlutterQuill, We decided to migrate to FlutterQuill, since the plugin Zephyr that the project depends on have not been updated for  
  a while and is not compatible with Flutter2.
